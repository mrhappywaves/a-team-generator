## Description
This is a Node.js command line application that takes in user's answers to predefined questions and applies that input to create a team web page. 

I made this application as a homework assignment. As I got further into writing the application I got intrugued because I realized that I can replicate my favorite show - "The Office". Once I get more free time I will definitely attempt to turn this into "The Office" replica in a separate repository. Throughout the process I solidified my Node.js and Inquirer.js skills, as well as I used Jest to run some simple unit tests to help me identify issues in my code.

## Installation Instructions
To get the project set up locally please follow the following steps:
 1. Make sure you have node.js installed
 2. Make sure you have inquirer.js installed
